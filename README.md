# wine-final
I like wine but I don’t understand it. I see no difference between a $2 Trader Joe’s bottle and any expensive French wine. I also think that wine connoisseurs are pedantic liars; wine preference is more subjective than objective in my mind. That being said, I wanted to test my hypothesis- are there key metrics that determine wine quality. Therefore, I wanted to see how likely it is to predict the quality of wine (on a 1-10 scale) based on the relationships of its variable components. I also looked at the distribution of quality within clusters to see if there's any latent structure connecting some of these variables to quality.
